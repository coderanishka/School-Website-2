      achieving our desired outcomes of education.<br><br>

      We desire every child stepping out of our institution to be:<br><br>

         resilient, knows himself, is discerning in judgement, thinks independently and
         critically and communicates effectively.<br><br>

      2. A self-directed learner who takes responsibility of his own learning, who
         questions, reflects and perseveres in the pursuit of learning. <br><br>
      
      3. An Active contributor who is who is able to work effectively in teams, 
         exercises initiatives, takes calculated risks, is innovative and strives 
         for excellence.<br><br>

      4. A concerned world citizen who has a strong civic consciousness, is informed
         and takes an active role in bettering the lives of others around him.<br><br>
