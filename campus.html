    <h2> Infrastructure </h2>
    <p>
      To be able to deliver effectively on our vision and our educational
      mission would not have been possible without the state of the art
      infrastructure we have invested into. The school makes sure the right
      facilities are made available to both our students as well as teachers to 
      make our dream come true.
    </p>
    <h3> Library </h3>

    <p>
      The library is one of the assets of our school. It is a treasure house of 
      knowledge, past and present. Gilded volumes decorate the glass chests.

      There are different shelves for different languages. Thus you can find books
       in Hindi, English, Marathi and so on. For each language books available may 
       belong to any one of the following heads â€“ drama, prose, poetry etc.
      
      There are also a number of reference books to help students understand subjects
      in a better and a well-detailed manner. The library is very well equipped and
      contains a collection of national dailies, magazines etc. The library is very 
      well utilized both by the students and the members of the staff.

    <h3> Digital Classrooms </h3>

    <p>
      The Lodha World School facilitates learning through audio-visual classrooms. In
      addition to learning from subject teachers, students enjoy learning from videos
      showed on the screens installed in every classroom.<br>

      <p>Computer Lab</p>
    </div>
    <p> Each classroom comprises of an interactive table monitor connected to a projector
      and speakers.
    </p>

    <h3> Laboratories </h3>
    <p>
      The school boasts of well-equipped laboratories for the sciences, maths as well as 
      for languages and computers. The role of the laboratory is central since the students
      must construct their own understanding of the subject ideas. Performing experiments 
      help students learn techniques and reinforce textbook concepts.
    </p>

    <h3> Experiential learning studio </h3>

    <p>
      An experiential learning studio is an innovative and pioneering concept. It is the
      physical space that allows for integrating the curriculum, manipulative sets, the 
      coaches and the students for a cohesive implementation of the program. Students are 
      encouraged to build their own understanding of the world and acquire knowledge through 
      vivid experiences. They are given the freedom to reflect on those experiences by asking
      questions, exploring their surroundings and making an assessment of their discoveries.

    <p>
      Thus, by applying themselves, challenging their minds, and making connections, students
      build the foundations to become autonomous learners, a key skill much needed in an unpredictable 
      and dynamic world.
    </p>

    <h3> Sports Facilities and Activity Rooms </h3>
    <p> 
      Books are not the only way students learn. Sports facilities and activity rooms are dedicated 
      specifically for students to pursue talents and interests. This ensures that we are able to 
      provide holistic education to your child so that they excel in their hobbies as well.
